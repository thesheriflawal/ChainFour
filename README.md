### Key Functions

```solidity
function createGame(string calldata roomId) external returns (uint256)
function joinGame(string calldata roomId) external
function makeMove(uint256 gameId, uint8 column) external
function forfeitGame(uint256 gameId) external
function getGameState(uint256 gameId) external view returns (...)
```

### Events

- `GameCreated` - When a new game room is created
- `PlayerJoined` - When second player joins the room
- `MoveMade` - When a player makes a move
- `GameFinished` - When game ends (win/draw/timeout)
- `GameAbandoned` - When game is abandoned

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- MetaMask browser extension
- Git

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/connect-four-blockchain.git
cd connect-four-blockchain
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. **Update contract configuration:**

```javascript
// In your config file
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x924172b50159CC1C6857AF841b93364B5ffA8b24";
const NETWORK_CONFIG = {
  chainId: 4202, // Lisk Sepolia
  chainName: "Lisk Sepolia Testnet",
  rpcUrls: ["https://rpc.sepolia-api.lisk.com"],
  blockExplorerUrls: ["https://sepolia-blockscout.lisk.com"],
};
```

5. **Start development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

### MetaMask Setup

1. **Add Lisk Sepolia Network:**

   - Network Name: `Lisk Sepolia Testnet`
   - RPC URL: `https://rpc.sepolia-api.lisk.com`
   - Chain ID: `4202`
   - Currency Symbol: `ETH`
   - Block Explorer: `https://sepolia-blockscout.lisk.com`

2. **Get test ETH:**

// Example: Create a new game
const contract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, ABI, signer);
const tx = await contract.createGame("ROOM123");
const receipt = await tx.wait();
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MetaMask Connection Issues**

   - Ensure you're on Lisk Sepolia network
   - Check that you have sufficient ETH for gas fees
   - Try disconnecting and reconnecting wallet

2. **Transaction Failures**

   - Verify contract address is correct
   - Check gas limit and gas price settings
   - Ensure game state allows the action

3. **Game State Issues**
   - Refresh page to sync with blockchain state
   - Check network connection
   - Verify you're in the correct game room

### Support

For technical issues or questions:

- Create an issue on GitHub
- Check the contract on block explorer
- Verify network connectivity
